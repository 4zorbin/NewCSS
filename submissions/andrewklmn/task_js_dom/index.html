      <h3>About stuff in our life</h3>
      <img src="img/stuff_overview.jpg" alt="Stuff overview"/>
      <p>
        I have too much stuff. Most people in America do. 
        In fact, the poorer people are, the more stuff they seem to have. 
        Hardly anyone is so poor that they can't afford a front yard full of old cars.
        It wasn't always this way. Stuff used to be rare and valuable. 
        You can still see evidence of that if you look for it. 
        For example, in my house in Cambridge, which was built in 1876, 
        the bedrooms don't have closets. In those days people's stuff fit in 
        a chest of drawers. Even as recently as a few decades ago there was a lot 
        less stuff. When I look back at photos from the 1970s, I'm surprised how empty 
        houses look. As a kid I had what I thought was a huge fleet of toy cars, 
        but they'd be dwarfed by the number of toys my nephews have. All together 
        my Matchboxes and Corgis took up about a third of the surface of my bed. 
        In my nephews' rooms the bed is the only clear space.
